      <h2>CIPHER TIME COMPARISON USING CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM APPROACHES</h2>
      <p>
        This project successfully explored the implementation and performance analysis of classical cryptographic algorithms—such as Playfair, Hill, and DES—within a quantum computing environment using Qiskit. By implementing these ciphers in both classical and quantum platforms, we gained insights into their computational behaviour, execution time, and scalability.
        <br><br>
        The study revealed that while quantum can replicate classical encryption logic, they generally exhibit higher execution time due to overhead and complexity in circuit design. This highlights the current limitations of quantum, particularly when run on classical machines.

    <h3>Automating File Management with Power Automate</h3>
    <p>
      I created a Power Automate flow that helps manage files in a SharePoint document library more efficiently. The flow automatically triggers whenever a file is created or modified. It first checks if a file with the same name already exists. If it does, the existing file is deleted, and the new one is copied in its place—ensuring only the latest version is kept. If no match is found, the file is simply copied. This logic uses conditions, loops, and comparisons to avoid duplication and maintain a clean, up-to-date file system.

    <h3>🚀 Just Built My Own Chatbot Using Microsoft Power Virtual Agents! 🤖✨</h3>
    <p>
      Excited to share a recent project where I created a smart chatbot powered by Microsoft Power Virtual Agents! I integrated an Excel knowledge base containing customer order details, enabling the bot to intelligently respond to queries about their orders. Whether it’s <em>“Where’s my order?”</em> or <em>“When will it arrive?”</em> — the bot’s got it covered. But that’s not all! I connected it with Power Automate to take things a step further — now, the bot can automatically send order details to the customer’s Outlook email the moment it gets a request! 
      This automation saves time, reduces manual errors, and enhances customer experience — a small glimpse of what low-code platforms can do!

    <h3>🎯 Power BI in Action!</h3>
    <p>
      Explored the visual side of data with this quick Power BI dashboard!
 📊 Bar & Column Charts
 🎯 Cards
 🍩 Donut Chart
 ⏱ Gauge Chart
 📂 Slicers for dropdown filtering. 
I used a sample course list from Excel, connected it to Power BI, and built an interactive report that lets users analyze data just the way they want.
Power BI isn’t just a tool—it’s a whole vibe! ✨
 Every click, drag, and drop taught me something new—and honestly, I enjoyed every bit of it.

    <h3>📊 Built Another Power BI Dashboard – This Time with a Twist!</h3>
    <p>
     ✔️ Dashboard Page:
 • Top 10 Customers (Table)
 • Area Graph
 • Donut + Bar Charts
 • Cards + Slicers
📄 Bonus: Added a new “Details” page using Bookmarks — when a user selects a condition from the dropdown, it reveals a focused table view of that selection!
Working with bookmarks felt like adding a secret door to my report 😄
 Every page, every filter made learning Power BI even more fun and rewarding!

    <h3>From local DB to live on Azure🙌🏻</h3>
    <p>
     Just built and deployed my own Student Info viewer using ASP.NET Core MVC + Azure SQL Database!

The main goal is to Connect my web app to Azure SQL and ensure every add/edit/delete action reflects instantly. Features I added:
1.Sign Up / Login / Logout, with passwords securely hashed before storing in the database.
2.A clean, user-only Students Table with full CRUD
3.Animated welcome content to keep it friendly
4.About Us & Contact Us sections with a neat footer
5.And finally... deployed the whole thing to Azure.This was a great hands-on project to practice real-time DB sync, add security, and explore full-stack basics — all the way to the cloud.

Tech Stack: ASP.NET Core MVC | Azure SQL DB | Entity Framework |Razor views| Visual Studio Community| Microsoft SSMS

    Tried out stored procedures in a real ASP.NET Core MVC web app — pulled student data straight from SQL and displayed it cleanly on screen. Simple, direct, and kind of cool to see SQL come alive in the browser.

    Integrated SharePoint, Power Automate, and Azure Functions to scan uploaded files for the keyword CONFIDENTIAL.
 If it's found → an email is triggered alerting the presence of sensitive data.
 If not → a green signal email saying “file passed validation.” 
Used Python with HTTP trigger in Azure — and plugged that into Power Automate using the HTTP action.

     Successfully implemented a seamless integration between SharePoint and Azure Blob Storage using Power Automate.Created a blob container in my Azure Storage account. Built a cloud flow that triggers when a file is created in SharePoint. Used HTTP PUT with a SAS URI to upload the file content directly to the blob
After multiple failed attempts and debugging headers, URIs, and content types — finally seeing that file land in the blob container felt incredibly rewarding!
